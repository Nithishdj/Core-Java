# ☕ Learning Core Java  

Welcome to my **Core Java Learning Repository**! 🚀  
This repo contains notes, practice programs, and examples that cover the fundamentals of Java programming.

## 📌 About Core Java  
Core Java refers to the **basic features of the Java programming language**. It is the foundation for all advanced Java technologies like Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, etc.  

Key concepts in Core Java include:  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- ✅ Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- ✅ Control Statements (if, else, switch, loops)  
- ✅ Arrays and Strings  
- ✅ Methods & Constructors  
- ✅ Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation  
- ✅ Interfaces & Packages  
- ✅ Exception Handling  
- ✅ Collections Framework  
- ✅ Multithreading  
- ✅ Input/Output (File Handling)

📖 Learning Roadmap

Start with Java basics (syntax, variables, data types).

Learn decision-making (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do-while).

Dive into OOP concepts (classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism).

Explore arrays, strings, and collections.

Practice exception handling and multithreading.

Learn file handling and I/O streams.
🎯 Goal

The goal of this repo is to practice and master Core Java fundamentals so that I can move on to advanced topics and real-world projects confidently.
