## 📌 About Core Java  
Core Java refers to the **basic features of the Java programming language**. It is the foundation for all advanced Java technologies like Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, etc.  

Key concepts in Core Java include:  
- ✅ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- ✅ Variables, Data Types, and Operators  
- ✅ Control Statements (if, else, switch, loops)  
- ✅ Arrays and Strings  
- ✅ Methods & Constructors  
- ✅ Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction, Encapsulation  
- ✅ Interfaces & Packages  
- ✅ Exception Handling  
- ✅ Collections Framework  
- ✅ Multithreading  
- ✅ Input/Output (File Handling)
